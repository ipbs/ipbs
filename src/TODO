iPBS ToDo Notes:
===============

 - Think about physical units
 - Compare solving whole geometry with making use of symmetry
 - Test 3D
 - Maybe we can give dimensionality and boundaries as parameter, so solver is universal
   NOTE This is by making use of the Cmd_params class!
 - Improve Cmd_Params
 - Implement Iterations

 - Write an output routine
 - Implement parallel - What is in there does not work!!!

far-goal:
 - Can we use dune's quadrature?
 - Understand GMSH and .msh format - Can give boundary values to programm?
   What about the dielectric constant?
