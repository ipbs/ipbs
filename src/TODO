iPBS ToDo Notes:
===============

 - Testing
 - Write an useful output routine for forces (see tyagi)
 - Implement parallel evaluation of boundary iteration
 - Dielectric Missmatch
 - 3D is either completely missing or wrong !!!
 - parametric surface
 - automated refinement in dune

 other notes
 -----------

 - be careful with creating meshes, the result of the integration is
   _highly_ dependent on the refinement in the area of high exponential
   decay and the radial invariance of the mesh refinement.
