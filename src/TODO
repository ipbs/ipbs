iPBS ToDo Notes:
===============

 - understand what parameter classes do!
 - Deal with boundary conditions
 - Implement PB-solver (existing in test)
 - Get spherical problem solved
 - Think about physical units
 - Compare solving whole geometry with making use of symmetry
 - Test 3D
 - Maybe we can give dimensionality and boundaries as parameter, so solver is universal

far-goal:
 - Implement iterative procedure
 - Can we use dune's quadrature?
